# Mike-Mike Reporting

SARES uses the Mike-Mike ([Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/operations/forms/go-kit-doc/mercalli)) reporting methodology.

If you feel a significant earthquake, please go to SARES channel 1 (or alternate).

When Net Control asks for your Mike-Mike report, give the Sunnyvale Fire District where you are presently located and your Mike-Mike number. For example:

_Kilo six sierra november yankee, fire district two, mike mike 5, K6SNY_

The Sunnyvale Fire District Map and Tally Sheet can be download from the [SARES Go Kit Forms repository](https://github.com/saresrg/Go-Kit-Forms/releases/latest) on GitHub.
