# Nets

## Monday Nights at 19:30

### SARES Net

SARES meets every Monday at 19:30 (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Guests and prospective menbers are welcome.

We usually meet on the primary K6SNY repeater:

SARES channel 1  
145.170 MHz  
Negative offset  
PL 94.8 Hz

On some Mondays, we meet on an alternate repeater or simplex frequency.

SARES channel 12  
444.525 MHz  
Positive offset  
PL 94.8 Hz

The simplex frequency for <span id="this_month"></span> is <span id="frequency"></span> MHz (SARES channel
<span id="channel_number"></span>, <span id="channel_name"></span>).

### SPECS Net

At 20:00, we transition to the [SPECS Monday Night Net](https://www.specsnet.org/monday-night-net).

After that, typically between 20:10 and 20:20, we return to SARES Channel 1 to gather late check-ins and conduct any remaining business.

## Tuesday Nights at 20:00

### SVECS Net

The Silicon Valley Emergency Communications System Net ([SVECS Net](https://www.svecs.net/)) meets every Tuesday at 20:00.

The SARES weekly check-in count from the preceding Monday night will be carried over and reported by a SARES representative. If you missed the weekly Monday net and want to check in on Tuesday, you need to do so as "late checkins for Sunnyvale" which will be called on the main SVECS net right after the Sunnyvale representative has reported in.
